# ELK Stack

**ELK Stack** is a collection of three open-source tools — **Elasticsearch**, **Logstash**, and **Kibana** — used together for searching, analyzing, and visualizing log and event data in real time.

- **Elasticsearch**  
  A distributed, RESTful search and analytics engine that stores and indexes large volumes of data quickly and efficiently.

- **Logstash**  
  A data processing pipeline that collects, transforms, and sends data from multiple sources to Elasticsearch.

- **Kibana**  
  A visualization and analytics platform that provides dashboards and tools to explore data stored in Elasticsearch.

> Together, the ELK Stack helps organizations monitor systems, troubleshoot issues, and gain operational insights from their data.
